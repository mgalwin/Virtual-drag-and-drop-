This project demonstrates a real-time hand gesture recognition system that allows users to interact with on-screen objects using only their hands. Leveraging the Mediapipe library and OpenCV, it detects hand landmarks through a webcam feed and enables a virtual "drag-and-drop" mechanism. The system identifies a pinch gesture (thumb and index finger coming together) to select and move a circular object on the screen. The object follows the fingertip when the pinch gesture is detected near it, offering an intuitive way to simulate touchscreen-like interactions without physical contact.
